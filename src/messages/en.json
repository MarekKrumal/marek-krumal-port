      "whyWasItCreatedDesc": "This is my largest project – a full-stack application built on Next.js. Users must first log in or register, with the option to sign in via Google. Authentication is handled by Lucia. Form validation is real-time thanks to the React Hook Form library. For the feed, I used React Query, which allows efficient data fetching, caching, and data revalidation as needed. React Query also implements infinite loading and optimistic updates, meaning actions like liking or following a user immediately reflect on the client before the request is sent to the database. The application supports creating posts with images or videos (with file size limits), uploaded via the UploadThing library, including drag-and-drop functionality for easier file uploads. Posts can be commented on through a fully functional commenting system. Searching is possible using hashtags (#example) or mentions (@example). Trending hashtags are cached every 3 hours. Users can edit their profile page, change their profile picture (with cropping options within the app), and update their bio. Notifications are also implemented – users are informed about new followers, likes on their posts, mentions, or incoming messages. The app includes a DM system integrated via a third party, Stream, offering features like group chats, file uploads, message reactions, and more. I also set up a cron job that automatically deletes unused uploaded files every 24 hours (e.g., when a user uploads an image for a post but doesn't submit the post). The latest feature added is the reposting option.",

Although it's not the ideal approach for learning programming, I deliberately chose a complex topic – neural networks – to balance the use of AI while learning something new. After gaining inspiration from various online sources, I developed a neural network visualizer. I wrote almost no code for this project; most of the work was handled by OpenAI's model. However, this doesn't mean it was easy. I initially started the project in Next.js, but due to compatibility issues with some libraries like react-latex and react-mathjax, I had to switch to Vite. Even with the --legacy-peer-deps flag and forcing the installation, I couldn't get these libraries to work in Next.js 15. Nevertheless, this project helped me better understand how neural networks function and their role in machine learning and artificial intelligence.",

Unfortunately, this causes issues like longer content loading times. The MongoDB database also has limitations – for example, when deleting a user, their comments remain in the database, which is a problem not addressed in this application. Nevertheless, the app includes functional basic features like liking, creating posts, and user login. I even implemented a simple chat application that allows sending messages to other users, but you need to specify the recipient's name accurately.

  <p>
          This site was primarily created so I could showcase my projects and
    introduce visitors to my work. From the very beginning, I knew I wanted
    to develop it in Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind – just like most of my
    projects.
  </p>

<h2 style="color: var(--blog-heading-color);">Approach and Development</h2>
<p>
  At the start, I had a clear idea of how the website should look and function.
  However, as I worked on the project, that vision gradually changed – I
  discovered better solutions that allowed me to significantly improve the
  original concept. Ultimately, I created a website that is not only fast but
  also easy to use, which is confirmed by the excellent results on PageSpeed
  Insights.
</p>

<h2 style="color: var(--blog-heading-color);">Technology and Optimization</h2>
<p>
  For posts and projects, I use slugs. Most of the content is pre-generated as
  static HTML using functions like
  <text style="color: var(--blog-function); font-weight: 700;">
    generateStaticParams
  </text> in the new App Router. I created the styling manually – initially, everything
  was colorful, but eventually, I decided on a simple and non-irritating design.
</p>
<p>
  I also learned to pre-render images using the Sharp library, which I write
  more about in my post

    Why Next.js Caught My Attention?
  </a>. One problem I encountered while creating the styling independently was the
  need to adjust colors separately for Dark and Light mode, but I managed in the
  end. Another complication arose when using React v19 and Next.js 15, where Next.js
  required `await`ing `params`, which caused some parts of my application to stop
  working. Even ChatGPT couldn't help me in this situation. Finally, after a long
  search, I came across a solution thanks to user <a

  <h2 style="color: var(--blog-heading-color);">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
          Overall, during the development of this website, I gained a lot of experience, whether in the area of
    performance optimization, accessibility, or design simplicity.
